    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of this week! You'll be building a very deep convolutional network, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras\n",
    "- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification\n",
    "- Implement a skip connection in your network\n",

    "Last week, you built your first convolutional neural networks: first manually with numpy, then using Tensorflow and Keras. \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, neural networks have become much deeper, with state-of-the-art networks evolving from having just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output). \n",
    "\n",
    "* However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode,\" from gaining very large values). \n",
    "\n",
